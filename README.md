Pyramid
=======

Build with blocks. Design before CAD.

Pyramid gets design data development out of CAD where it belongs. This leaves CAD to do what it does best: visual layout development.

Pyramid is intended to be an intranet webserver that allows CAD designers to create blocks and packages of blocks before touching CAD. These blocks contain block attributes with a Pyramid unique ID.  This allows for creating blocks outside of CAD and more importantly regularly updating drawing block attributes by script.
